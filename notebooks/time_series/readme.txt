1) To run the project:

	1.1 Edit inp.txt
		format: YYYY MM DD l tl
		where	l is the number of initial days
			tl is the trajectory length

		example:

			an inp.txt cointaing the line "2016 10 12 3 5" (without quotes) will produce 5 runs. The first run will start on Oct 12 and the last on Oct 16, 2016, with each trajectory being 3 days long.

	1.2 Run main.py

2) Resullts and errors.

	2.1 The program will produce a results directory, where you can see the final results (traj.txt) and an error directory, where you can see the erros Ariane encountered (if any)

	2.2 Provided tl is small: to quickly find trajectories that would produce errors and get their respective error messages (written by me, NOT Ariane), run the project and ctrl + c for each day to skip the runs.
